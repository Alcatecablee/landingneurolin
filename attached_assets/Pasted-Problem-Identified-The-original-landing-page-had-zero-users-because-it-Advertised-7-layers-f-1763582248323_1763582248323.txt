Problem Identified
The original landing page had zero users because it:

Advertised "7 layers" (features) instead of problems solved
Didn't clearly communicate what bugs/issues the CLI fixes
Lacked compelling before/after examples
Had no clear pain points addressed
Solution Implemented
Problem-First Messaging based on architect guidance:

✅ Lead with pain points:

Hydration crashes (window is not defined)
Missing React keys flooding console
React 19 breaking changes
600+ ESLint errors blocking deploys
Accessibility gaps failing audits
Next.js App Router migration
✅ Show, don't tell:

Before/after code examples in hero
Real terminal output demo
Specific problem → solution mapping
✅ Clear value proposition:

"Fix React & Next.js Bugs Before They Ship"
"No AI. No guesswork. Just working code."
"100% Free, No API Keys Required"
